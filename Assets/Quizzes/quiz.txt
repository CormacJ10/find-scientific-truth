*10 x spice*

Ye gods, that curry! I'm sweating like a pig and my whole mouth stings...
Why did I order so much extra spice? Even my mind is on fire!

*A, B, or C?*
Should I see a movie? Go to karaoke? Or just eat ramen? I can't decide... so I'll do 'em all!

*Adjusting*
I've been undercover here long enough now that I can finally tell the different types of Shibuya kids apart.
Aha! There's the suspect!

*All good*
Wild Boar's a popular brand, huh?
I just got complimented on my clothes.
I only bought them 'cause they're baggy enough to cover my gut...

*Bad idea*
Ugh, these new shoes! My heels are killing me... The fronts are really long, so I bought a size smaller than usual. Urg, bad idea.

*Can't win*
Ugh, work is such a pain.
I oughta just quit. Then I can do whatever I feel like as much as I feel like.
Ugh, that sounds like a pain, too.

*Chameleon*
After seeing that croc at Shinta's place, I really want a pet...
Maybe a chameleon? Wonder how you even take care of 'em... Better ask Shinta.

*Chicks*
If I were taller, girls would think I was so hot...
But I stopped growing years ago.
Maybe I'll get an afro instead!

*Cool*
The shops around here are super trendy...
A little too trendy.
I don't think I'm cool enough to go inside.

*English?*
アメリカのともだちに　にほんのサムライソードを　もってかえると　やくそくしたのに…
どこでうってるんだろう？
えいごが　つうじないから こまってるね

*Powerful*
There's just something about Shibuya...
All these people coming together,
wrapped in their own hopes and dreams...
It's just a powerful feeling.

*Present*
Augh, the girlfriend wants a Pegaso watch for her birthday... Geez, I haven't bought it yet, and my wallet's already crying uncle!

*Ramen*
Ramen, ramen... I guess I eat it every day.
Maybe I should try something new...
What am I thinking?!
Unless it's greasy, it's just not food!
Yup. Ramen's the way to go.

*Third eye*
I have eyes on the back of my head.
I can FEEL what's happening behind me—so when a celeb shows up in Shibuya, I'm always the first to ID them!

*Tired*
I'm so tired of plain old hamburgers. If only there were gourmet burgers... Like, a caviar burger, or a foie gras burger... or a truffle burger!

*Train fare!*
Oh, no! Sold out!?
I was dying to play that game!
Plus, I wasted money on the ride over...

*Um, 'scuse me*
Everybody's in such a hurry...
No one stops long enough for me to ask for directions!
Guess I'd better wait for a red light...

*Weebers*
Uhh, I'm not good with crowds... Crowds bring out those symbols—the weebers! I can see them everywhere! There! Clinging to that guy's back — WEEBERS!!! Weebie weebie weebie...

*What now?*
Ugh, my poor stomach.
What's the point of having a good store around for herbal medicine if the guy has to LIKE you? That's not fair, I say!
Just not to him, 'cause he's scary.

*Women*
Whew! I agreed to go shopping with her, but I didn't know we'd be walking around all day! I'm gonna pretend I'm lost and take a break.

*90 calories*
All right, I can have another
90 calories today.
Should I go for ramen? Ice cream?
Ooh, if I'm getting ice cream,
I should hit that dessert buffet
90 minutes, all you can eat!

*All-nighter?*
I'm glad my friends care enough to ask me if I'm getting enough sleep, or if I'm feeling sick... but I'm totally fine!
What, is my face puffy or something?

*Attractive*
Heh heh, the guys can't take their
eyes off me today.
I must look stunning in this outfit
I just bought at—huh?
Oh, I forgot to take the tags off...

*Bad girl*
"Don't get any thinner," he said. Well, I don't want to let my honeybear down... so from now on, it's three full meals a day and snacks every two hours!

*Blew it?*
Ugh, my poor hair... Frizzy hair is the worst!
Well, at least it's nice out...
As soon as it rains, I turn into Afrodite...

*Box set*
That hot new game will be out soon! I'm sooo getting in line for the limited edition. Heck, just lining up with everyone is like a big party!

*Can't go home*
Ohh, why does my place have to have roaches? They're so creepy! Can't someone get rid of them for me? Wonder if Dad'll do me this one favor...

*Catty*
CAT won't do interviews that show his face.
Why not? Is he that butt-ugly? Or...
Don't tell me CAT's actually a cat!?

*Clones?*
So then, CAT's this group of twenty different creators... all with the same face?
Makes sense... I think?
Is that even possible?

*Concert*
That trio from Shibu-Q Heads is playing today. I like their sound, but it's the funny between-song banter that does it for me.
Hmm, what was the band's name again?

*Crisis?*
I can't believe the Shibu-Q trio broke up! Everybody but Iwata quit! You can't have a band with just vocals...
It's probably his fault, though, for hogging the spotlight...

*Date?*
Another mail? Get it through your
head, man; I don't like you!
Besides, I already promised another guy
I'd go see fireworks with him.
Speaking of which—I'd better hurry
home and fire up that dating sim!

*Dreams*
If I go to the beauty salon now, I'll fall asleep for sure.
But then again...at least in my dreams that hunky stylist actually talks to me!
Win!

*Girly girl*
I don't know why I've never been into frills and ribbons before—they're so cute!

*I'm onto you*
Hey! You there!
Peeping at my thoughts, huh?
I know you are!
Well, if you think you can mind-control me or something, you're sorely mistaken!
